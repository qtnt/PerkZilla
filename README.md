Have You USED This Tool for Creating Successful Viral Promotions Massively?

I want to ask you a question…

Just how many SUCCESSFUL viral promotions perhaps you have created?

Take note the keyword there: successful.

I’m not discussing those promotions where you start a product, competition or video and also have tumbleweeds blowing over the content. A few dozen stocks isn’t exactly an outrageous success, you understand?

I’m discussing the type of marketing campaign that sweeps across your market truly. The type of advertising campaign that has your own content turning up in your cultural media newsfeeds frequently for days. The type of marketing campaign where you’re viewing hundreds if not thousands or even an incredible number of likes, shares and comments.

Guess what happens?

You understand it’s possible. Take a look at YouTube or Facebook right now just, and you’ll see videos which have been seen an incredible number of times. MILLIONS.

However the question is, exactly what does it try create that type of massive buzz in your specific niche market?

Obviously, you will need good content. You will need something shareworthy. You need something that individuals are happy or proud to share with their friends. That’s something useful really, something that arouses feeling, or something that’s really valuable.

Now here’s the thing…

A bit could be had by you of content that meets those qualifications, and your viral campaign could do a huge ol’ belly flop still.

Why?

Just because a viral advertising campaign is similar to a stay of dynamite - it’s not going to look “boom” if you don't have a match to light the fuse.

And that’s where PerkZilla comes in…
